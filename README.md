# Otopack-Mods-Updates
Otopack 2, forked from Kenan's version of Otopack which is forked from the original version of **Survival_Man's** (**the first and the main creator of Otopack soundpack**) 

I don't play Dark Days Ahead. Support is not guaranteed but maybe some day I'll play it or EOD.

## Music 
All the music has been kindly suggested, provided by awesome and very supportive and helpful people and contributors: The Go-Goat/Cuddlebaby and Kaldeqca. If you don't like it or want to replace it with other music it's possible to simply erase all music files from music folder to not play with it at all or add your own preferred music in ogg or mp3 files format then edit musicset.json file to add compatibility to it essentially 

## Prerequisites 
A computer that can run Bright Nights. 
A computer that can play sound.
A device to playback audio.
~~the will to live~~
